<p style="font-size:larger">The Saffron colour at the top of the flag stands for courage and selflessness. It is also a religiously significant colour for the Hindus, Jains, and the Buddhists as it stands for renunciation and absolution of the self or 'Ego'. This colour is proudly donned by the renunciants and is also meant to remind the political leaders to work selflessly for the good of the country.It stands for the courage of those soldiers who have dedicated their lives to protecting their motherland. And lastly, it stands for those priests and renunciants, who are aware of the absolute truth and pray for the welfare of people.</p></div>
