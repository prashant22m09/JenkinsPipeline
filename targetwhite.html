<p style="font-size:larger">The white stripe in the middle of the Indian National flag stands for peace, honesty, and purity. The colour stands for knowledge and cleanliness as well. Its political significance is the constant reminder that the leaders need to maintain peace and harmony throughout. This is particularly suggested keeping in mind the bloodshed that preceded and followed the partition of the country. Religiously, it is a pious colour, signifying the absolute truth as well as the guiding light taking us towards it.Â </p></div>
